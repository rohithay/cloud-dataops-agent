## Features
The set of tools provided by the GCP Cost Optimization MCP server can be broken down into four categories:

1. Cost Analysis & Monitoring
- Retrieve BigQuery costs, billing breakdowns, and usage analytics across projects
- Detect cost anomalies and predict budget overruns using ML models
- Monitor query performance and identify expensive patterns in real-time
- Generate executive cost reports with trend analysis and optimization opportunities
2. Intelligent Query Optimization
- Analyze SQL queries for cost impact before execution using dry-run APIs
- Provide AI-powered optimization suggestions using Claude/GPT integration
- Automatically rewrite queries for better performance and lower costs
- Create optimized dbt models and materialized view recommendations
3. Multi-Agent Automation
- Deploy specialized AI agents for different cost optimization domains
- Automate GitHub PR creation with optimization implementations
- Send intelligent Slack notifications with cost context and remediation steps
- Orchestrate cross-platform optimizations across BigQuery, Vertex AI, and Composer
4. Operational Intelligence & SLA Management
- Monitor data pipeline SLA compliance and cost efficiency metrics
- Provide recommendations for slot reservations and committed use discounts
- Track optimization impact and ROI of implemented changes
- Integrate with existing dbt workflows and CI/CD pipelines
