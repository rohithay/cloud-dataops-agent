## Installation
| Cursor | VS Code |
|:------:|:-------:|

You can download the GCP Cost Optimization MCP Server from GitHub. To get started using your favorite AI assistant with MCP support, like Claude Desktop, Cursor.

Add the following code to your MCP client configuration. The GCP Cost Optimization MCP server uses the default GCP project from your ADC by default. Specify a value in `GCP_PROJECT_ID` if you want to use a different project. Similarly, adjust the `GCP_REGION` configuration values as per your setup.
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gcp-cost-optimization": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "quantium.gcp-cost-optimization-mcp@latest",
        "--allow-write",
        "--allow-sensitive-data-access"
      ],
      "env": {
        "GCP_PROJECT_ID": "your-gcp-project",
        "GCP_REGION": "us-central1",
        "ENABLE_MULTI_AGENT": "true"
      },
      "disabled": false,
      "autoApprove": []
    }
  }
}
```

## Using service account credentials
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gcp-cost-optimization": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["quantium.gcp-cost-optimization-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS": "/path/to/service-account.json",
        "GCP_PROJECT_ID": "your-gcp-project",
        "GCP_REGION": "us-central1"
      },
      "disabled": false,
      "autoApprove": []
    }
  }
}
```

### Testing the configuration
Every time you start Claude Desktop, it will attempt to load any configured MCP Servers. You should see output indicating that the MCP Server has been discovered and initialized.

If you're running into issues, check out the [troubleshooting guide](./troubleshooting.md) or open a GitHub Issue.
